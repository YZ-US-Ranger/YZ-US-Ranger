Instead of calling this course “Survival analysis in R”, we should actually have called it “Time-to-event data analysis in R” because we will discuss methods where the event does not have to be death. The reason why we still called it “Survival analysis in R” is because this is the most commonly used term.

We will discuss duration times. Usually, we are interested in a certain event (for example, death) and want to know the time until this event happens. The event of interest can be very diverse, but we are always interested in the time until this event occurs.

```r
# Check out the help page for this dataset
help(GBSG2, package = "TH.data")

# Load the data
data(GBSG2, package = "TH.data")

# Look at the summary of the dataset
summary(GBSG2)
```

Why do we need special methods for time-to-event data? Why can’t I just compute a linear model?

1.Duration times are always positive.

So we need to work with distributions that can handle positive outcomes. The linear model, for example, assumes a normal distribution, which is not very appropriate for positive outcomes. A common distribution to model duration times is the Weibull distribution and the corresponding model is called the Weibull model.

2.Different measures are of interest.

Historically in survival analysis, the survivor function has been a measure of interest.

3.Censoring (probably the most important)

the most common type of censoring in survival analysis: right censoring.
